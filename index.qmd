## Overview

Heterogeneity has been more and more important in empirical analysis

As a first step to heterogeneity analysis, this paper

- Propose semiparametric tests for the presence of HTE
- 2-step procedure:
  - AIPW transformation on the outcome
  - Project the transformed outcome on the covariates, test joint significance of BLP coefs
- Test heterogeneity in ATE/LATE in the same framework
- Only requires standard outputs from statistical software
- High-dimensional case: Double Machine Learning

## Setting

- Treatment status: $W_i = 0, 1$
- Covariates: $X_i$
- Potential outcomes for individual $i$: $Y_i(1)$ if treated, $Y_i(0)$ if untreated
- Observed outcome: $Y_i = W_iY_i(1) + (1 - W_i)Y_i(0)$
- CATE: $\tau(x) = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)|X_i]$
- ATE: $\bar\tau = \mathbb{E}[\tau(X_i)]$

::: {.fragment}

Two pairs of hypotheses:

1. $H_0: \tau(x) = 0$ for all $x \quad$ **vs.** $\quad H_a: \tau(x) \neq 0$ for some $x$
2. $H_0: \tau(x)$ is constant for all $x \quad$ **vs.** $\quad H_a: \tau(x)$ is not constant for some $x$

## Rubin's Causal Framework

<br>

Rubin's causal framework, and further define:

- Conditional expectations of the potential outcomes $\mu(w, x) = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(w)|X_i = x]$
- Propensity score $e(x) = P(W_i = 1|X_i = x)$

Assumptions:

- Unconfoundedness: $W_i \perp (Y_i(1), Y_i(0)) | X_i$
- Overlap: $\exists \xi > 0$, s.t. $\xi \leqslant e(x) \leqslant 1 - \xi$ for all $x$

## A primary idea

1. Transform $Y_i$ to $\hat{Y}^*_i$ by IPW, such that $\mathbb{E}[\hat{Y}_i^*|X_i = x] = \tau(x)$
$$
\hat{Y}_i^* = \frac{W_i Y_i}{\hat{e}(X_i)} - \frac{(1 - W_i)Y_i}{1 - \hat{e}(X_i)}
$$
where $\hat{e}(x)$ is some consistent estimator of $e(x)$

2. Estimate the BLP coefficients $\beta = (\beta_c, \beta_x')'$ of $\hat{Y}^*_i$ on $X_i$ by OLS. Then the two pairs of hypotheses translate into
$$\begin{aligned}
&H_0: \beta = 0 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_a: \beta \neq 0 \\
&H_0: \beta_x = 0 \quad \text{vs.} \quad H_a: \beta_x \neq 0
\end{aligned}$$

::: {.fragment}

[Challenge:]{.blue}

- $e(x)$ unknown, plugging in $\hat{e}(x)$ affects the asymptotic distribution of $\hat\beta$
- Two cases: parametric/nonparametric estimator $\hat{e}(x)$

:::

## AIPW Solution to the Challenge

1. Transform $Y_i$ by [AIPW]{.blue}, and $\mathbb{E}[\hat{Y_i^*}|X_i = x] = \tau(x)$ holds
$$
\hat{Y}^*_i = W_i\frac{Y_i - \hat\mu(1, X_i)}{\hat{e}(X_i)} - (1 - W_i)\frac{Y_i - \hat\mu(0, X_i)}{1 - \hat{e}(X_i)} + \hat\mu(1, X_i) - \hat\mu(0, X_i)
$$
with consistent estimators $\hat{e}(x)$ and $\hat\mu(w, x)$

2. The OLS estimators $\hat\beta$ has the [standard asymptotic distribution]{.blue}

::: {.callout-note #prp-asym}

(Consistency and Asymptotic Distribution)

Under regularity conditions, 

$\hat\beta \xrightarrow{p} \beta$

$\sqrt{n}(\hat\beta - \beta) \xrightarrow{d} N(0, V)$ where
$$
V = \mathbb{E}[X_i'X_i]^{-1}\mathbb{E}[X_i'X_i\epsilon_i^2]\mathbb{E}[X_i'X_i]^{-1}
$$

:::

and thus, the tests are implemented by standard [Wald tests of joint significance]{.blue}

## Wald Test of Heterogeneity

<br>

::: {.callout-warning #thm-test}

(Hypothesis Tests for CATE)

Assume Unconfoundedness and Overlap holds, under $H_0: (\beta_c, \beta_x')' = 0$, the Wald statistic
$$
W_1 = (\hat\beta_c, \hat\beta_x')(\hat{V}/n)^{-1}(\hat\beta_c, \hat\beta_x') \xrightarrow{d} \chi^2(p + 1)
$$

and under $H_0: \beta_x = 0$, the Wald statistic
$$
W_2 = \hat\beta_x'(\hat{V}_{xx}/n)^{-1}\hat\beta_x \xrightarrow{d} \chi^2(p)
$$

## Heterogeneity Tests with IV

With a binary IV $Z_i$,
$$
CLATE(x) = \frac{\mathbb{E}[\hat{Y}_i^*|X_i = x]}{\mathbb{E}[\hat{W}_i^*|X_i = x]}
$$

- $Z_i$ is the treatment in the AIPW transformation of $Y_i$ and $W_i$
- Let $\beta$ and $\alpha$ denote the BLP coefficients in the numerator and denominator respectively
- $H_0: CLATE(x) = 0$ for all $x$ translates into $\beta = 0$
- $H_0:$ constant $CLATE(x)$ translates into $\alpha_x = \beta_x$

Obtain $\hat\alpha$ and $\hat\beta$ by one regression, and implement [Wald test + Delta method]{.blue}
$$
\begin{bmatrix} \hat{Y}^* \\ \hat{W}^* \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{1} & \mathbf{0} & X & \mathbf{0} \\ \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{1} & \mathbf{0} & X\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\beta_c \\ \alpha_c \\ \beta_x \\ \alpha_x \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} \epsilon_{1} \\ \epsilon_{2}  \end{bmatrix}
$$ 

## High-dimensional Covariates

<br>

If $X_i$ is high-dimensional,

heterogeneity in CATE/CLATE can be tested with respect to a [low dimensional subset of covariates $b(X_i)$]{.blue}

- Estimate $e(x)$ and $\mu(w, x)$ with machine learning (e.g. lasso, tree-based methods, neural net)
- Project $\hat{Y}_i^*$ on a low-dimensional subset $b(X_i)$

<br>

- Fits into the [Double Machine Learning (DML)]{.blue} framework in @chernozhukov2018double
- A set of regularity conditions is given to prove the DML theory
- The choice of $b(X_i)$ is binding by the regularity conditions

### CATE Tests

**Effect of One-child Policy on the mental health of the only children in China**

- Data constructed by @xie2014introduction, analyzed by @zeng2020being
- $W_i$: Being the only child; $Y_i$: Confidence, Anxiety, Desperation ranging 1 to 5
- Covariates:
  - Personal features: age, urban, gender, majority, marriage, income
  - Parents features: education, marriage, income

<br>

- Zero CATE rejected for all three mental measures at $1\%$ level
- ATE estimates: $-0.088$, $0.005$, $-0.067$. **ATE on Anxiety statistically insignificant**
- Constant CATE rejected for all three mental measures at $1\%$ level

### BLP coefficients

## Conclusion {.center}

- 2-step tests for the presence of heterogeneous treatment effect

- Straightforward to implement because the first step can be ignored due to AIPW

- Flexible and work with CATE/CLATE/High-dimensional cases

- Properties of the tests are shown in simulations

- In applications, we illustrate the use of the tests and its assistance to subpopulation analysis

**More in the paper**

- Proof of the semiparametric efficiency of the BLP coefficient estimators
- Another application (401(k) pension plan) for illustrating the tests with IV and DML
