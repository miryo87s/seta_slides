## Overview

<br>

- Propose semiparametric tests for the **presence of Heterogeneous Treatment Effect (HTE)**
- Two-step procedure:
    1. **Augmented Inverse Propensity Weighting (AIPW)** transformation on the outcome
    2. Project the transformed outcome on the covariates, test **joint significance of projection coefs**
- Test conditional ATE/LATE in the same framework
$$
\mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)|X_i = x], \quad \quad \mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)|\underbrace{W_i(Z_i = 1) = 1}_{\text{compliers}}, X_i = x]
$$

- Combine the tests with Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML) to deal with high-dimensional covariates

## Setting and Hypotheses for CATE

**Potential Outcome Framework**

- Treatment status: $W_i = 0, 1$
- Covariates: $X_i$
- Potential outcomes for individual $i$: $Y_i(1)$ if treated, $Y_i(0)$ if untreated
- Observed outcome: $Y_i = W_iY_i(1) + (1 - W_i)Y_i(0)$
- CATE: $\tau(x) = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)|X_i = x]$
- ATE: $\bar\tau = \mathbb{E}[\tau(X_i)]$

**Two pairs of hypotheses:**

1. $H_0: \tau(x) = 0$ for all $x \qquad \quad \ \ $ **vs.** $\quad H_a: \tau(x) \neq 0$ for some $x$
2. $H_0: \tau(x)$ is constant for all $x \quad$ **vs.** $\quad H_a: \tau(x)$ is not constant for some $x$

## Identification of CATE

::: {.callout-warning}
## Identification Assumptions for CATE

**Unconfoundedness:** $W_i \perp (Y_i(1), Y_i(0)) | X_i$

**Overlap:** $\exists \xi > 0$, s.t. $\xi \leqslant e_0(x) \leqslant 1 - \xi$ for all $x$

:::
where $e_0(x) = P(W_i = 1|X_i = x)$ is the propensity score.

- Further define $\mu_0(w, x) = \mathbb{E}[Y_i(w)|X_i = x]$
- Then the AIPW transformation is

$$
\hat{Y}^*_i = W_i\frac{Y_i - \hat\mu(1, X_i)}{\hat{e}(X_i)} - (1 - W_i)\frac{Y_i - \hat\mu(0, X_i)}{1 - \hat{e}(X_i)} + \hat\mu(1, X_i) - \hat\mu(0, X_i)
$$

- Under identification assumptions, $\mathbb{E}[\hat{Y}^*_i|X_i = x] = \tau(x)$

## Related Literature

- This paper studies the **same hypotheses as in @crump2008nonparametric**
  - But use different methods and extend to heterogeneity in LATE
- Employ the idea of inference on **conditional effects with IPW**
  - @abrevaya2015estimating; @chang2015nonparametric; @hsu2017consistent; **@sant2021nonparametric**

<hr>

The closest paper to mine is **@sant2021nonparametric**:

- **@sant2021nonparametric**: distributional besides average effects, and allow for right-censored data, which I do not have
- On the other hand, I have the unique features:
  - Tests are [straightforward to implement]{.blue} by using AIPW instead of IPW, as only standard outputs from statistical softwares are required
  - Develop tests in the presence of [high-dimensional covariates using DML]{.blue}
  - [Projection coefficients]{.blue} of conditional effects are estimated, which can provide a profile of the heterogeneity

## Why AIPW?

<br>

- In the literature, IPW is commonly used to identify CATE
- What is the benefit of using AIPW?

1. Semiparametric Efficiency
    - Related to test power
2. Simplify the formula of asymptotic variance 
    - Easier to implement in practice
3. **The resulting moment is Neyman Orthogonal, which is a key condition for using DML** 
    - Extension to high-dimensional controls

## AIPW: Parametric Estimation

<br>

**Two-step procedure**

1. Transform $Y_i$ by **AIPW** with consistent **parametric** estimators $\hat\mu(w, x)$ and $\hat{e}(x)$ to obtain $\hat{Y}^*_i$

2. Estimate the projection coefficients $\beta_0 = (\beta_0^c, \beta_0^{x'})'$ of $\hat{Y}^*_i$ on $X_i$ by OLS. 

$$
\hat\beta = \arg\min_\beta \frac1n \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (\hat{Y}_i^* - X_i\beta)^2
$$

Then the two pairs of hypotheses translate into
$$\begin{aligned}
&H_0: \tau(x) = 0 \qquad \qquad \rightarrow \quad H_0: \beta_0 = 0\\
&H_0: \tau(x) \text{ is constant} \quad \rightarrow \quad H_0: \beta_0^x = 0
\end{aligned}$$

## AIPW: Inference

- The key to the hypothesis tests is deriving the asymptotic distribution of $\hat\beta$
- Need to take into account plugged-in $\hat{e}(x)$ and $\hat\mu(w, x)$

$$
\sqrt{n}(\hat\beta - \beta_0) = \left(\frac1n \sum_{i = 1}^{n} X_i'X_i\right)^{-1} \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \left(X_i\epsilon_i + \underbrace{X_i'\frac{\partial\hat{Y}^*_i}{\partial \gamma} (\hat\gamma - \gamma_0)}_{\color{red}{\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} \sum \cdot\rightarrow 0 \text{ because of  AIPW}}}\right)\right)
$$
where $\gamma$ are the parameters in $\hat{e}(x)$ and $\hat{\mu}(w, x)$. Thus, $\hat\beta$ has the [standard OLS asymptotic distribution]{.blue}

::: {.callout-note}

## Proposition 3.2(Asymptotic Distribution)

Under regularity conditions and $\hat\beta \xrightarrow{p} \beta_0$, $\sqrt{n}(\hat\beta - \beta_0) \xrightarrow{d} N(0, V)$ where
$$
V = \mathbb{E}[X_i'X_i]^{-1}\mathbb{E}[X_i'X_i\epsilon_i^2]\mathbb{E}[X_i'X_i]^{-1}
$$

:::

## Extension to DML

**DML procedure:**

1. Transform $Y_i$ by AIPW with [ML estimators]{.blue} $\hat{e}(x)$ and $\hat{\mu}(w, x)$. A wide range of ML methods can be applied.
2. The OLS estimators $\hat\beta$ with [cross-fitting]{.blue} has the standard asymptotic distribution as in the parametric case.

**Cross-fitting:**

![](fig/crossfit.png){fig-align="center"}

## Extension to DML

<br>

**Two key conditions to use DML:**

1. **Neyman Orthogonality** <br> I prove that the moment function of projecting **AIPW** transformed $\hat{Y}^*_i$ on $X_i$ is **Neyman Orthogonal**, namely
$$
\partial_\gamma \mathbb{E}[g(D_i, \beta, \gamma_0)][\gamma - \gamma_0] = 0
$$
where $\partial_\gamma$ is the Gatueax derivative operator and $\gamma = (e(x), \mu(w, x))$ is infinite-dimensional parameter with
$$
g(D_i, \beta, \gamma) = X_i'(\hat{Y}^*_i - X_i\beta)
$$

2. Provide regularity conditions on the **moment** and on **ML estimator** $\hat\gamma$

## Wald Test of Heterogeneity

<br>

Thus, given the asymptotic distribution and a consistent estimator of the variance, the tests are implemented by [Wald tests of joint significance]{.blue}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Theorem 3.1(Hypothesis Tests for CATE)

Assume Unconfoundedness and Overlap holds, under $H_0: (\beta^c_0, \beta_0^{x'})' = 0$, the Wald statistic
$$
W_1 = (\hat\beta_c, \hat\beta_x')(\hat{V}/n)^{-1}(\hat\beta_c, \hat\beta_x') \xrightarrow{d} \chi^2(p + 1)
$$

and under $H_0: \beta_0^x = 0$, the Wald statistic
$$
W_2 = \hat\beta_x'(\hat{V}_{xx}/n)^{-1}\hat\beta_x \xrightarrow{d} \chi^2(p)
$$

:::

## Setting and Hypotheses for CLATE

- When Unconfoundedness does not hold and a binary IV is available, conditional LATE is identified by
$$
CLATE(x) = \frac{\mathbb{E}[\hat{Y}_i^*|X_i = x]}{\mathbb{E}[\hat{W}_i^*|X_i = x]}
$$

- $Z_i$ is the "treatment" in the AIPW transformation of both $Y_i$ and $W_i$
- Let $\beta_0$ and $\alpha_0$ denote the BLP coefficients in the numerator and denominator respectively
- The analogous hypotheses for CLATE:
  - $H_0: CLATE(x) = 0$ for all $x$ translates into $\beta_0 = 0$
  - $H_0:$ constant $CLATE(x)$ translates into $\frac{\beta_0^x}{\alpha_0^x} = \frac{\beta_0^c}{\alpha_0^c}$

Obtain $\hat\alpha$ and $\hat\beta$ by one regression, and implement [Wald test + Delta method]{.blue}
$$
\begin{bmatrix} \hat{Y}^* \\ \hat{W}^* \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{1} & \mathbf{0} & X & \mathbf{0} \\ \mathbf{0} & \mathbf{1} & \mathbf{0} & X\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}\beta_c \\ \alpha_c \\ \beta_x \\ \alpha_x \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} \epsilon_{1} \\ \epsilon_{2}  \end{bmatrix}
$$ 

## Simulated Size of the Tests

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Designs

$$
Y_i(w) = \mu_0(0, X_i) + \tau_0(X_i) \cdot w + \epsilon_i, \quad Pr(W_i = 1|X_i) = e_0(X_i)
$$

Designs:

1.  $\mu_0(0, x) = 1 + \sum_{p = 1}^{2}x_p$; $\tau_0(x) = \alpha \sum_{p = 1}^{2}x_p$; $e_0(x) = 0.5$

2.  $\mu_0(0, x) = 1 + \sum_{p = 1}^{2}x_p$; $\tau_0(x) = \alpha \sum_{p = 1}^{2}x_p$; $e_0(x) = 1 / (1 + \exp(-1 - 0.4x_1 + 0.2x_2))$

3.  $\mu_0(0, x) = 1 + \sum_{p = 1}^{2}x_p$; $\tau_0(x) = \alpha (x_1 + x_2 + x_1 \cdot x_2)$; $e_0(x) = 1 / (1 + \exp(-1 - 0.4x_1 + 0.2x_2))$

4.  $\mu_0(0, x) = 1 + \sum_{p = 1}^{2}x_p$; $\tau_0(x) = \alpha(1\{x_1 > 0\} - 1\{x_1 \leqslant 0\})$; $e_0(x) = 1 / (1 + \exp(-1 - 0.4x_1 + 0.2x_2))$

IV: Linear outcome and TE functions similar to Design 2, but with a binary instrument that has a logit propensity score

### Result

Compared with the tests developed by @crump2008nonparametric

## Application

::: {.panel-tabset}

### CATE Tests

**Effect of being the only children on mental health in China**

- Data constructed by @xie2014introduction, analyzed by @zeng2020being
- $W_i$: Being the only child
- $Y_i$: Confidence, Anxiety, Desperation ranging 1 (worst) to 5 (best)
- Covariates: Personal and parents' socio-demographic features

<br>

- Zero CATE and Constant CATE **rejected** for all three mental measures at $1\%$ level
- ATE estimates: $-0.088^{***}$, $0.005$, $-0.067^{***}$
  - Being the only children decreases confidence and exacerbates desperation
  - The insignificance of the effect on anxiety can be **misleading if focused on ATE only**

### BLP coefficients

## Conclusion

<br>

- Two-step tests for HTE that are straightforward to implement
- Flexible and unified method for CATE/CLATE/high-dim cases
- In applications, we illustrate the use of the tests and its assistance to subpopulation analysis

[Caveats:]{.blue}

- Rejecting $H_0$ is sufficient but *not* necessary for the existence of HTE
- Able to assess HTE with respect to a subset of the available covariates and not only the entire set
  - With high-dim covariates, need to project TE on a low-dim subset
  - Regularity conditions are binding the choice of this low-dim subset
  - Or recursively project on each covariate and transform the high-dimension problem to multiple testing with adjusted significance level
